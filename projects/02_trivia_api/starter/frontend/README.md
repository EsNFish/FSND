<h2>Starting the Frontend Server</h2>

1) Navigate to the frontend directory 
2) Run `npm install` if you do not see a folder titled node_modules in the fronend directory. (This should only need to be done once)
3) Run `npm start` to start the server.

Once started, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ if a browser didn't already open to the page when the server started.

Note: none of the questions will load if the backend server has not been started.
